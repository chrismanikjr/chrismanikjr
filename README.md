### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chrismanto Natanail Manik. I'm an iOS Developer with almost 3 years experience and I'm hugely passionate about mobile iOS development. A developer with a production app on App Store using Swift and a second on the way I am committed to clean design and clean code.
With a wide variety of cross-transferable skill including strong communication skill at all level, self-motivation to a high standard as well as the desire to learn and problem solve I believe I would be the perfect candidate for any iOS Developer role
